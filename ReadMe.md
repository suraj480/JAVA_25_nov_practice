### Jagged array :-an array of arrays of which the member arrays can be of different lengths, producing rows of jagged edges when visualized as output.
#### method overloading :- it may be defined as the methods with same name but with different parameters

stack memory:- last in first out
Heap memory:-

### An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class. It has static constants and abstract methods.
The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. There can be only abstract methods in the Java interface, not method body. It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.

# enum
An enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants (unchangeable variables, like final variables).
you can extends enum with any other class

# Threads 
Threads allows a program to operate more efficiently by doing multiple things at the same time.
Threads can be used to perform complicated tasks in the background without interrupting the main program.

# Collection API- it is concept
# collection -it is interface
# collections - it is class
